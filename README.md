# üî¢ Lazzaretti Joias calculator üíç
The idea of having a jewelry calculator came to me when I realized I was losing too much of my time by quoting prices all day. 
So, I wondered: "Andrey, why don't you just develop a program that do it for you? And better, you can deploy it on your future site and remote repository!"
Said and done! So on 2020 I created this solution using pure Python. 

# üöÄ Techniques
This time, on 2022, I developed the same tool, but using ReactJS. With less code lines than usual, I was able to create this beautiful application - thanks MUI. Aware that the user would do the same thing many times, I also added three buttons: one to send the quote by WhatsApp, other to redo the message and other to copy it to the clipboard.
About the styles, on this project, instead using the traditional CSS3 archive, I decided to use Material UI. When it comes to beautiful design with few styling code lines, this library proves it's value!

# üìú Feedback
I can say it was an excellent experience! I realized what I should learn and foresight how to solve many programming problems. I also have learned better uses to React State and data sharing among components - It was not necessary to use contexts.
I finished the project with two results: a ready to use calculator, to share on my GitHub, and a tool, that would make my quotes take a lot less time.

# ü§î How I would improve it
I'm still saving the used information in the FrontEnd package, even though I know it is not the best way, since the data is still exposed. The best solution to storage data safely, is with a good backend code and dataBase. In the future, with more knowledge and content, I hope to refactor the data section, using NodeJS or Python to keep the data safer - this knowledge will be necessary to develop what I've been planning.
